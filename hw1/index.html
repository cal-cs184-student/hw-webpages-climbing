		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we were able to get introduced to the wonderful world of rasterization and antialiasing. 
		Starting off with task 1 with drawing simple triangles which kicked off our first 
		image renderings ever! We then moved onto supersampling and antialiasing in task 2 
		for a bit more complex approach to task 1. These triangles now look smoother with some more samples per pixel, as well as some blurring!
		Then, we moved onto transforms and barycentric coordinates, which had some cool results as well with Cubeman and color wheel.
		Finally, for tasks 5 and 6, we put it all together to rasterize real images smoothly and textured (with accurate perspective)!
		Now every time we look at a pixelelated image, we can say that we know how to smooth it out!
		Fun fact: Nicole can never look at pixelated art the same again (so many jaggies).
		

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		We first calculate the two corners defining the bounding box for the triangle by taking the (minX, minY) and (maxX, maxY). We then check for clockwise or counterclockwise winding order using the right-hand rule. To do this, we calculate two vectors starting from one vertex, then take the cross product of them. If the result is negative, the points are in clockwise order, else they are in counterclockwise order. After we determine the winding order, we loop through all the points (center of pixel using +0.5, +0.5) inside the bounding box and check whether it’s inside our triangle. We only loop through all the points in the bounding box once, therefore our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. We created a helper function for this that basically takes a point and 3 triangle points (passed-in in counterclockwise order) and does three line tests. If all 3 turn up >= 0, the point is inside the triangle or on the boundary, else it’s outside. Then we call <code>fill_pixel()</code> on the points inside the triangle using the given color.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p>We modified <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> to instead of sampling once every pixel, we sample sqrt(sample_rate) * sqrt(sample_rate) times per pixel. To calculate the position within a single pixel, we do this calculation: <code>(x + (xi + 0.5) * increment, y + (yi + 0.5) * increment) </code> where xi and yi are values indicating the (xi, yi) position within the pixel. We scale this down by setting <code>increment = 1.0 / sqrt(this->sample_rate)</code>.We use the same helper function that does 3 line tests to determine if the sample is within the triangle. If it is, we set the corresponding sample_buffer index to be the color. Sample_buffer has a size of <code>width * height * sample_rate</code>. Each pixel (x, y) is represented by the range of indices <code>((width * y + x) * sample_rate</code> to <code>(width * y + x) * sample_rate + sample_rate)</code>. When <code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> is called, we then downsample back down to the original number of pixels by averaging the colors in the corresponding sample_buffer indices that make up 1 whole pixel. To do this, we start with rgb(0,0,0). We then add the colors in the corresponding pixel from sample_buffer to this rgb value. After we have looped through the whole pixel, we average the value by dividing by the sample_rate.</p>

        <p>
            This supersampling is useful because it allows us to get rid of jaggies (antialiasing)! Instead of only sampling once per pixel, we can sample multiple times and take the average color value of that pixel to create a smoother effect.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		Cubeman is star-jumping to show joy and excitement! We changed his color to be warm orange to express more joy!! To do this, we slightly unrotated his head, and then rotated his left and right legs by 45 and -45 degrees respectively.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Barycentric coordinates represent a point as a linear combination of a triangle’s vertices. They represent the point in terms of weights for each of the 3 vertices. These weights correspond to how much each vertex contributes to the position of the point. The sum of the three weights always equals 1. If a point is closer to one vertex, its weight for that vertex will be larger. In computer graphics, we can use barycentric coordinates to take the colors at 3 vertices and blend them together to form a gradient by making hybrid colors at each point inside the triangle.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling is when you approximate a color of a pixel while keeping the texture in 
		mind (3D surface rather than 2D). Because when we’re switching from screen space to texture space, 
		the sampling rate changes often and isn’t constant. With magnification and minification, we need to 
		apply different methods of texture filtering. Essentially, we took points on the unit uv space and 
		converted them as points in the texture space, rather than a color, to map onto our world space, 
		resulting in the final screen space. Similar to Task 4 with the implementation of barycentric coordinates 
		in our rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle function, we replaced the color object with a texture color 
		point within our tex object. Nearest sampling is when you round to the closest point in the tex map that 
		corresponds to the current mipmap layer we’re using. Bilinear sampling uses the 4 closest points and implements 
		linear interpolation to find horizontal and vertical interpolation to get “in-between” values.

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div> 

		<p> With these 4 images, we can see quite a big jump when we go from a sample rate of 1, nearest sampling, to a sample rate of
			16 using bilinear sampling. Even between the different sampling methods within the same sampling rate, you can still see how 
			the nearest sampling is always a bit more aliased than the pixels in the bilinear sampling. It is especially noticeable on high-contrast 
			areas with high frequencies.
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div> 

		Notice how the edge of the Berkeley seal is smoother on Bilinear Sampling than the jaggies on the Nearest Sampling.
		
		
		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is used for minification, another type of texture filtering, 
		when you have the texture mapping of an image, but depending on the location of the image due to 3D 
		perspective, the sampling rate changes and we try to pick a resolution that most closely corresponds to 
		that screen sampling rate. This is achieved through mipmaps, and in our implementation, we added on top 
		of our existing Task 5 code how to choose a layer, different types of sampling depending on the rate/method 
		we choose, and added the derivative uv values. All of these combined allow us to accurately rasterize the 
		3D texture onto the screen space.

		<p>The tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power for number of samples per pixel: 
			increased samples means decrease speed, increase memory usage, but your antialiasing is much better (due to higher quality sampling). Super-sampling 
			stores many color values per pixel, leading to memory increase as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power for pixel sampling: speed increase in nearest sampling compared
			to bilinear sampling, as bilinear essentially means finding and sampling 4 points each. However, antialiasing power
			is better in bilinear as a result. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power for level sampling: your speed is higher
			because you use lower resolution layers for lower sampling rate areas of your image. Memory usage is 4/3, and 
			antialiasing can be "less" effective, because you use lower resolution farther from the image, but overall makes 
			your image rasterization more accurate overall.
